Matt Riker's main responsibility in this project was implementing the algorithm for the Minimax decision tree while Andrew Ho worked on the player() and move() functions as well as setting up the main account on github.

For assignment 2, Andrew Ho implemented the Alpha-Beta Pruning to help improve our AI to beat the constant player and the better player.

The biggest improvement we made to our AI to make it tournament worthy was using the Alpha-Beta Pruning to make our algorithm more efficient. To improve the AI even more, we implemented a minimizing frontier approach.
